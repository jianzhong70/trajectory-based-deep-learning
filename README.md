GaMD simulations are performed to enhance conformational samplings of proteins.
The trajectories are transformed into images for deep learning.
Two-dimensional (2D) convolutional neural network are constructed to perform deep learning.
The results from deep learning are visualized.
Reaction coordinates are obtained from deep learning to construct free energy landscapes.
Free energy profiles are used to reveal molecular mechanism on effect of G12C mutation and partner binding on conformational dynamics of KRAS4B.
